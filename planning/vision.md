we want a product site tool that you can upload or run in the terminal on any codebase. It will write every single different kind of test dynamically, generatively, designed to break it and find bugs after reading the code and ingesting it all as context. We're using AI. We'll have an API key, and there's maybe 20 different kinds of categories. We're going to do more research online to see if it's extensive, comprehensive, or exhaustive. We really want it to be finding bugs, because this is going to be sold as enterprise software where we're intelligently finding hacks and problems, looking at the code and trying to break it. That's why it's called Pinata. We're trying to beat the shit out of the codebase with incredible intelligent test creation and bug finding.
